Create a modular XRP arbitrage trading system with the following requirements:

ARCHITECTURE - MODULAR DESIGN (Like LEGO Blocks):
Build separate, reusable modules that can be easily maintained and extended:

Core Modules:
- api_connector.py: MEXC exchange API connection
- price_monitor.py: Real-time XRP/USDT and XRP/USDC price monitoring
- balance_manager.py: Wallet balance management and stablecoin rebalancing
- trade_executor.py: Trade execution logic (sell first, then buy)
- risk_controller.py: Risk management and safety checks
- data_logger.py: Transaction logging and history
- profit_analyzer.py: Profit/loss analysis and statistics
- config_manager.py: Configuration management

Interface Modules:
- main_gui.py: Main control panel (tkinter)
- monitor_gui.py: Separate trading monitor window (tkinter)
- chart_display.py: Charts and visualizations
- alert_system.py: Alert and notification system

Business Logic Modules:
- arbitrage_engine.py: Main arbitrage strategy engine
- trading_strategy.py: Trading decision logic
- data_pipeline.py: Data processing pipeline

APPLICATION STRUCTURE:
Create TWO separate GUI applications:

1. MAIN CONTROL PANEL (main_gui.py):
- Real-time market display (XRP/USDT, XRP/USDC prices, spread)
- Wallet balance display (USDT, USDC, XRP)
- System time display
- Trading configuration settings:
  * Spread trigger threshold (default: 0.003, configurable)
  * Trade amount per transaction (default: 100 XRP, configurable)
  * Daily maximum trade volume (default: 5000 XRP, configurable)
- Control buttons: API Connect, Start Trading, Stop Trading
- Today's trading summary (total trades, total profit/loss)
- Clean, professional trading interface design

2. TRADING MONITOR WINDOW (monitor_gui.py):
- Real-time trading activity feed (unlimited entries)
- Comprehensive profit/loss analysis dashboard:
  * Today's P&L
  * Cumulative P&L
  * Success rate statistics
  * Average profit per trade
  * P&L trend charts
- Historical trade query functionality
- Statistical charts:
  * Trading volume distribution
  * Spread fluctuation charts
  * Time period analysis
- Risk monitoring alerts
- Professional trading terminal appearance

TRADING LOGIC:
- Monitor XRP/USDT vs XRP/USDC price spread on MEXC exchange
- Execute arbitrage when spread >= configurable threshold
- Trading sequence: ALWAYS sell first, then buy (mandatory order)
- Maximum 3 pending orders due to latency tolerance
- Automatic stablecoin rebalancing (USDT/USDC) when imbalance detected

RISK MANAGEMENT:
- Price volatility protection
- Balance safety margins (10% safety buffer)
- Order timeout handling
- Error handling and logging
- Trading frequency limits

PROFIT ANALYSIS FEATURES:
- Real-time P&L tracking
- Trade success rate calculation
- Average profit per trade
- Maximum drawdown tracking
- Time-based performance analysis
- Visual profit trend charts
- Risk-adjusted returns

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Python with tkinter for GUI
- ccxt library for MEXC API integration
- Modular architecture for easy maintenance and expansion
- Configuration file support
- Comprehensive error handling
- Logging system
- Data persistence

DEPLOYMENT:
- Cloud-ready for 24/7 operation
- Environment variable support for API keys
- Automatic restart capabilities
- Resource optimization

Create this as a complete, professional-grade trading system with clean code architecture, comprehensive documentation, and production-ready features.
